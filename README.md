# LCR module demo data

This repository hosts a synthetic Tumour-Normal pair for lcr-modules CI tests (see https://github.com/LCR-BCCRC/lcr-modules)

- BALC-0008_2018-03-18: A fully synthetic (all SNPs and SNVs were manually chosen and inserted) tumour sample representing capture-based sequencing data
- GIAB-normal: A "normal" sample generated from Genome In A Bottle (https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201625), restricting sequencing reads to the capture regions
- synthetic_captured_panel: A BED file lsting the sequenced regions
